## Features
- Name tags will no longer render through opaque blocks and objects, but will remain visible through transparent ones like glass.

- If a name tag is partially obstructed, only the visible part will be drawn.

- This feature applies to both players and mobs.

## Configuration
You can configure the mod by editing the `config/realisticnametag-client.toml` in your Minecraft folder.

- **`disableInSpectator`**: Set this to `false` if you want the mod's effects to remain active while in spectator mode. (Default: `true`)
